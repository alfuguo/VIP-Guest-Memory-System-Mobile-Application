## Test Configuration

### Test Dependencies
- **JUnit 5**: Modern testing framework with parameterized tests
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for unit testing
- **Spring Boot Test**: Integration testing support
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for repository tests
- **Spring Security Test**: Security testing utilities

### Test Properties
- **Location**: `src/test/resources/application-test.properties`
- **Configuration**: H2 in-memory database, test-specific security settings

### Test Utilities
- **TestConfiguration**: Custom test configuration for beans
- **Test Data Builders**: Consistent test data creation patterns

## Testing Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity and maintainability.

### 2. Mocking Strategy
- Mock external dependencies (repositories, services)
- Use `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` annotations
- Verify interactions with mocked dependencies

### 3. Test Data Management
- Use `@BeforeEach` for consistent test setup
- Create realistic test data that reflects production scenarios
- Use builders for complex object creation

### 4. Security Context Testing
- Mock Spring Security context for authentication tests
- Test role-based access control scenarios
- Verify audit logging integration

### 5. Database Testing
- Use `@DataJpaTest` for repository layer tests
- Leverage `TestEntityManager` for test data setup
- Test custom queries and complex relationships

## Requirements Validation
